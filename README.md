chess dogrusu

2 player chess game written in C. I tried to add as many features as I could(en passant, promote etc.). Code can definitely use more optimization. Check the header file chess.h for details.

There are 2 players. The game starts and each player first types the piece they want to move and then the position for example "E2" then E4". The game continues until a mate occurs.
